Team Reflection 6 (19/10-2022)
This sprint has only been half a week long since we've planned the last retrospective on wednesday and then we plan on working on and turning in the course-retrospective til friday. For this reason we haven't planned any tasks related to the project other than documentation. We've also focused a lot on the presentation and also setting up the website with docker for better easy of use during the presentation. 

	Code Quality
This sprint we've improved our documentation. We've come to realize that we need to store the web utils as an environment variables and not just in a plain file as we do now, but havent yet had time to do change this.
