Individual Reflections - Week 5
David Azizi - Team Navarro

• What do I want to learn or understand better?
As a member of my team I want to make sure that I deliver my part of the weekly contribution and that my work aligns with my team members work. I plan on doing this by attending the sprint meetings.

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help my team by organising discussions during the sprint meetings.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As a member of a scrum team I contribute to the team’s use of Scrum by discussing the time estimation of tasks, attending meetings and participating in supervision sessions.
I display my sprints work to my team members during the stand up meetings.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the team’s deliveries by finishing the bicycle page and by gathering CO2 emission data for every day items.
