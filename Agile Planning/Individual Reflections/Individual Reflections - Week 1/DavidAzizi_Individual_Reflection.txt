Individual Reflections - Week 1
David Azizi - Team Navarro

• What do I want to learn or understand better?
My knowledge of Git is limited and in order to streamline the development of the coming project I will read on how to solve merge conflicts.

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I am new to Chalmers and to the team I am not familiar with the skills which my team members possess and can therefore not know if I can show my team something the already don't know.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
During the agile lego project I was the designer of the buildings 
and the legacy builder. I currently don't believe that I need to switch from this role.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I added content to the social contract.
