#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since we have yet to finalize the direction of our project I don't have anything 
I wish to look into specifically. But I do wish to understand how to use Scrum 
tools effectively such as Trello. If we ever make an app then I would like to learn
the android development SDK and kotlin multiplatform. 

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since I have learned basic Java/Kotlin and web based languages (HTML, Typescript, Vuejs) 
I can assist and give advice on my teams code. Since I have worked on several web based projects
such as dynamic websites and Rest Apis I think I will assist quite well on that regard. 

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

During the pussle workshop I was the time keeper and for the Lego workshop I co-built the boat
and co-rebuilt the store. During both workshops I have provided some suggestions on how we can 
improved however not all were applied. 

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

Regarding the project itself I reviewed the social contract and sparked conversations regarding
what kind of project we would want to develop.
