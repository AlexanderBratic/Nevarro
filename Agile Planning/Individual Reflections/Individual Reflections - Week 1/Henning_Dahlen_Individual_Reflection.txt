WEEK 1
what do I want to learn or understand better?
	How to use the agile system in a way that significantly improves the process. I've worked at Volvo for a long time and there the agile system was often just another process to keep track of and follow, it was many times a micromanaging nightmare.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	I'm not quite sure yet, I guess we'll figure that out. But if there's something i can help someone with then i certainly will.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	So far i played scrummaster in the lego-session and we've also met up to plan the social contract and the upcoming weekly meetings. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	So far only my part in the social contract.
