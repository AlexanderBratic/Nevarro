what do I want to learn or understand better?

  Now I feel like I have a pretty theoretical idea of Agile. I want to get a more practical feel to it aswell.
  My new job will work using Agile and Scrum so I will learn there.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  I can take what I have learnt here and maybe come with a new vision to my next job/project of ways to improve.
  
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  This week I have tried to make constructive comments on all the reflections inorder to really think about
  what we have learnt.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  I worked togheter with the others on the final report and did my share of the presentation.
