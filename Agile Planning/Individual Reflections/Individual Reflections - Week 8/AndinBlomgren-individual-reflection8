I want to understand more thoroughly how to think and plan when working agile, how to not miss things that could have improved and changed the workway. It sounds way more ideal than my experiance, but if it is as effective as described I would definietly want to learn how to be efficient.

I can help the team through adding my experiance and opinions regarding prioritisation and allocations of our skills.

My contribution toward my teams use of scrum has so far been mentioning possible changes and misstakes not to execute again, my personal opinions and inspirations regarding the agile workway.

My contributions to my teams deliveries this week has been setting up a running docker container on my server at home to make the presentation easier and more fault free. During this setup we noticed a couple of bugs that would prevent us from delivering the product. We solved this problem but it will still remain until implemented.
