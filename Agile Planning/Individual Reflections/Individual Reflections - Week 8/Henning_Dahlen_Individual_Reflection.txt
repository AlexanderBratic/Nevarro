WEEK 4
what do I want to learn or understand better?
	This hasn't really been relevant this sprint.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
	 This hasn't really been relevant this sprint.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
	This week i became acting PO though this has been a bit of a weird sprint since it's only 50% as long and has been mostly focused on the presentation and final retrospective so I've mostly just made some tickets for the team relating to documentation and given feedback to the team at the retrospective.	

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
	This week I have mainly worked on the presentation and wrapping things up so I haven't completed any tasks related to the actual product except for some minor documentation.
