what do I want to learn or understand better?

  Currently I really understand more about the agile method, and seem to understand now how it can be beneficial. I want to still
  understand more how the PO plays in the next week I will be PO and will be able to experience it more.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  This week I pushed on KPIs and MVP and thinking more in terms of the users what they gained. I want to learn even more so 
  next week as PO I will roleplay more and think in the perspective of a user.
  
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  This week I pushed more that we should change over way of working for the next week. Next week is the last sprint so
  it will be hard to see more benefits here.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  This week it was a real joy programming seeing things come togheter. I want to contribute more next week. I want to do this
  by making the tasks smaller so they are more chewable and joyful to complete.
