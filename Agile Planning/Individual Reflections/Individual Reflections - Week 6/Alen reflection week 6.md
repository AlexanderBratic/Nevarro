#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Nothing in particular at the moment, right now it's time for the finishing touches so understanding my team's code.

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I give feedback on their code and helped people when they asked questions about react.
.
#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have assited the PO with creating new tasks and resolved merge conflicts so the code can be more overviewable.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have created some inputs at the comparison page to change start and destination along with implementing the usage of getting data from our api. I also resolved some merge conflicts.
