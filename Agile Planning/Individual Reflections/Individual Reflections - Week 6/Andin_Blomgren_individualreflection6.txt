Individual Reflection week 5

I still want to understand the structure of react better, I've been working all week with it and it still feels cluttry and annoying to use. But my understanding has increased.

I've been trying to hel√• the team by contributing with my problems and potential ways to solve both mine and others, we've been talking a lot about git and react and how to work better as a team by understanding and using both better.

My contributions to the scrums have been trying to act and be as motivating as possible.

My contributions to the team deliveries this week has not been much, I've been working on a tasks that took way longer than expected and I'm hitting breakpoints where I originally didnt think that I would hit them.
