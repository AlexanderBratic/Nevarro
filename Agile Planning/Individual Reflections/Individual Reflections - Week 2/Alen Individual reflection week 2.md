#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

So far will we need to use React for our front end and use google maps api along with web scraping to gather data. So I wish to learn react along with material ui for the front end.
And learn how to do web scraping with java and possibly Spring boot REST as well.

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can assist with the HTTP communication, CSS and typescript. React and java spring boot framework is new to me but I can attempt explain them if needed.
Many seems to be new to the architecure of having the frontend and API separated so I can help with archetecting that.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I have given several suggestions for archetatual decisions for how we should handle the project going forward as well as helping the breakdown of various tasks.
I have gone with the mindset that architectual decisions had to be done early so we don't have to handle stress of doing major changes later.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have helped with the planning of the website and API along with pointing for where to read for those that are curious. I will also soon setup the projects before
the next sprint meeting.
