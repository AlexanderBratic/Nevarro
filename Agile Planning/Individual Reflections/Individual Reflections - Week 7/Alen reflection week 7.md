#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Nothing in particular at the moment, maybe understanding my team's code.

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I give feedback on their code and helped people when they asked questions about react. I have sent links in our group chat regarding usable components to point them in the
right direction.

I have participated in the discussion for the team reflection, aditionally I have given feedback to some team members during standup meetings.
