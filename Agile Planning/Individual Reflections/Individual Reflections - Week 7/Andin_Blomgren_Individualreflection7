I want to learn and understand more about why the use of scrum and sprints are different from normal meeting and talking about eachothers workloads. I find the thought of optimising being rather stressful compared to the yielding results.

I can help the team and the others to learn new things by introducing them to problems and prioritisations depending on how the current sprint has gone.

My contribution towards my teams use of scrum has mostly been trying to achieve and optimise our way of working, talking about problems and potential solutions. When and what to do with different sorts of problems.

My contributions to my team deliveries has mostly been a non-working map that has a hard time communicating with our API, either that or there is something missing from the code on my part.
