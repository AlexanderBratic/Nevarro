what do I want to learn or understand better?

  Currently I only have wage ideas of our mistakes and what could have gone better, I 
  want to have a more concrete understanding of how we could have improved. I can do this
  by partition in all parts of our report and reflect effectivly. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

  Now it is time for the report so the parts I write I want to be of good quality. 
  
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

  I can futher my teams contribution towards Scrum by writing good reflective content about how I thought we
  did during the sprints and hopefully stir some thoughts.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

  I was happy with my contribution this week, had to put in more hours to do it but this came because I took 
  time to grow some more into the react development mindset.
