Individual Reflection week 4 Andin Blomgren

It was a bad decision to take on a task together with someone else when there is no avaliability to work together in school during the time. And I could've made some more contribution to the result we got in the end, rather than settling with the other persons code when we worked together. 

I contribute to helping the rest of the team by trying to be as motivating as possible and also making sure that neither I nor them take too much responsibilty so we work better as a team.

My contribution to the teams use of scrum is helping eachother balancing the workload and and improve each and everyones motivation to making it work.

My contribution to the deliveries has only so far still been only making a mockup and helping my teammate when working with him, I chose to not use my part of the code since my taskmates progress was better than mine.
