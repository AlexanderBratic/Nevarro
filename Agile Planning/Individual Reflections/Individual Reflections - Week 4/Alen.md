#### What do I want to learn or understand better?

Right now I want to learn how the google API looks like and how to manipulate the a map embed in react.

#### How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I will be assiting some team members that feel that they're lagging behind so they can get up to speed.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I will now act as the Product Owner in the coming sprint and during this sprint I have given feedback to the team's code.

#### What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I have a mostly finished startpage that needs to be intergrated with the other pages and I have made a draft car settings page which is
missing read/write to session storage.
