Individual Reflection week 3 Andin Blomgren

I have spent the week learning react and knowing how to implement it into our project, I would've liked to write some actual useful code but not so much yet. I will reach this goal by when I learn something through documentation or reading, I test the kind of code that I've read about.

I can help this team by sharing how interactions with git, and programming logic kind of works. I have had a lot on my hands the part week so my goal is to increase my activity within the gruop outside of meetings.

My contribution to the teams use of scrum is talking about ways to improve our communication within the group and how to work together, ask questions and dos/don'ts. I reached what I wanted to contribute with and is something I only would want to improve, what can be improved I am not aware of yet.

My contribution so far to our team deliveries isn't that much, so far this week it's only been learning react and creating a mockup of the task at hand. So to fix this I am going to work on the project during the weekend and next week spend more of my "free time" learning and experimenting with code so I reach results faster.
