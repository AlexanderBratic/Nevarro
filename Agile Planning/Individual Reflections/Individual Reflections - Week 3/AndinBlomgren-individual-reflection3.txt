Individual Reflection week 3 Andin Blomgren

I can spend more time coding and interacting with the code I'm trying to learn. Rather than only study theories and reading documentation.

I can help the rest of the team by sharing my interactions with git, other programming languages and also other project experiances.

My contribution to the teams use of scrum is to try and help the rest of the team in ways to inprove our scrum usage and things to think about.

My contribution so far to our team deliveries isn't that much, so far this week it's only been learning react and creating a mockup of the task at hand.
