Individual Reflections - Week 2
David Azizi - Team Navarro

• What do I want to learn or understand better?
The current situation is that I'm not accustomed to the aglie development method.
I want to become more efficient at the aglie development method and I plan on getting closer at that by adopting agile practises.

• How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since the team and I are not familiar with React I can consider working with it during the project so that I and the team can learn something new.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contribution to the team's use of scrum is to aid in the creation of fiting User Stories. To make sure that they are of appropriate size.

• What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I contributed to the presentation pitch and to the creation of the Buisness Model Canvas.
